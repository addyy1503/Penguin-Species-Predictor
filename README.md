# Penguin-Species-Predictor
This project is a machine learning classification model that predicts the species of a penguin based on physical features like bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, and sex.  The model is trained on the Palmer Penguins dataset and focuses on predicting three species:  Adelie  Chinstrap  Gentoo

-What this project does:-
Takes real-world biological measurements as input,
Preprocesses and cleans the dataset (handling missing values & encoding categories),
Trains a supervised ML model to classify penguin species,
Evaluates performance using accuracy and other metrics,
Predicts the species for new, unseen data,

-Tech Stack:-
Python,
Pandas & NumPy (data handling),
Scikit-learn (model training & evaluation),
Matplotlib / Seaborn (visualization)
